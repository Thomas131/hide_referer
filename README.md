hide refferer
=============
This scipt hides the refferer when clicking a link by redirecting to this script and re-redirecting to the prefered site. This is a minimal script written just in some lines of js. Because the redirect-link is written as anchor, the destination is never transmitted to the server (unless the code is compromised and it is sent to the server by js).

The URLs will look like this: [https://thomas131.github.com/hide_refferer/redirect.html#https://example.com](https://thomas131.github.com/hide_refferer/redirect.html#https://example.com)
Forks, reuploads, ... are more than welcome to make this tool more decentrialized.
