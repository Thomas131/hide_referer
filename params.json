This is a minimal script written just in some lines of js. Because the redirect-link is written as anchor, the destination is never transmitted to the server (unless the code is compromised and it is sent to the server by js).\r\n\r\nThe URLs will look like this: [https://thomas131.github.com/hide_referer/#https://example.com](https://thomas131.github.com/hide_referer/#https://example.com)\r\nForks, reuploads, ... are more than welcome to make this tool more decentrialized.\r\n\r\nThis code is licensed as [![image](https://licensebuttons.net/p/zero/1.0/88x31.png \"CC0\")](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\r\n\r\nWhy not a 302-Redirect?\r\n-----------------------\r\nFor sure, 302-redirects have lots of advantages (less overhead, no JS, ...) but they have at least one disatvantage: The Server knows the source (refferer) and the destination. The less data the server has, the less data can be stolen.",
