This is a minimal script written just in some lines of js. Because the redirect-link is written as anchor, the destination is never transmitted to the server (unless the code is compromised and it is sent to the server by js).\r\n\r\nThe URLs will look like this: [https://thomas131.github.com/hide_refferer/redirect.html#https://example.com](https://thomas131.github.com/hide_refferer/redirect.html#https://example.com) You can also download this repo with \r\n```sh\r\ngit clone https://github.com/Thomas131/hide_refferer.git\r\n```\r\nor by downloading [https://github.com/Thomas131/hide_refferer/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/Thomas131/hide_refferer/archive/master.zip). Than the URL's will look different.\r\nForks, reuploads, ... are more than welcome to make this tool more decentrialized.\r\n\r\nThis code is licensed as [![CC0](https://licensebuttons.net/p/zero/1.0/88x31.png)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
